### Overview

What does how we connect to the environment say about our relationship to it? This Leaflet Story Map attempts to answer this question through sounds captured while walking or swimming in South Florida's green or blue spaces. While these recordings are a sample of the sounds that can be heard throughout South Florida, they are meant to engender similar perspectives elsewhere. The regions of our research include Coral Gables, Coconut Grove, Hollywood, South Miami Garden, North Beach, Westchester, and Everglades National Park. The mapped soundscapes look to challenge stable definitions of wilderness and wild. The sounds recorded in these spaces are records we believe worth digitizing and making public because they capture the entanglement of human and nonhuman throughout urban and natural spaces in South Florida.

The project as a whole seeks to reassert the agency and history of animals in assumed human spaces and the reality of our shared ecosystem, even in a region of 6.1 million people [^1]. We hope that by making these sounds public, local and aspiring residents or visitors who may not otherwise find these areas accessible to them may explore the soundscapes that represent South Florida's human and more than human ecosystem. More than anything, these soundscapes are evidence of our taking pause to listen and connect with the place we are living in. The project is less about the sound bite and more about taking that pause and listening in/to South Florida. Our hope is that these unique - limitly preserved- soundscapes transform how you experience your own environment, wherever and whenever you are.
